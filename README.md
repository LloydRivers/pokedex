# Full Stack Open Course - Custom Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal project for the "Full Stack Open" course. This repository is the result of my journey to modernize the original project, introduce TypeScript for type safety, and delve into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices. If you've encountered difficulties with outdated content and webpack-related issues in the course's original project, this project aims to provide a fresh, up-to-date alternative.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a full-stack application using the latest technologies. Building this project from scratch allows me to deepen my understanding of the "Full Stack Open" course concepts and refine my web development skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** I'm utilizing modern front-end technologies like Next, TypeScript, and contemporary CSS frameworks to craft a responsive and user-friendly user interface.

- **Back-end:** For the back-end, I've chosen Node.js with the Express framework to construct a RESTful API.

- **CI/CD:** My focus is on setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate build, testing, and deployment processes.

## Goals and Objectives

- Develop a modern, type-safe, and responsive application.
- Gain an in-depth understanding of CI/CD practices and workflows.
- Enhance skills in full-stack web development.
- Improve knowledge of Next, TypeScript, and relevant technologies.
- Create a clean and maintainable codebase with proper documentation.

## Project Structure

The project adheres to a standard directory structure, segregating front-end and back-end components. This ensures a well-organized and modular codebase, promoting scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started

To embark on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for both front-end and back-end components.
3. Launch the development server and start coding.

## Contributions

While this project primarily serves my personal learning goals, I wholeheartedly welcome contributions, suggestions, or feedback. If you have improvements or ideas, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Let's learn and grow together!

## Todo List

We are at MVP. The app is working as intended but many refactors need to happen after I set up CI/CD.

- [ ] Convert to 100% TypeScript
- [ ] Add more Tailwind components
- [ ] Make use of server components and look at removing custom hooks
- [ ] Simplify logic for changing cards on the details page

## Likely Additions

In the future, I plan to explore enhancements and integrations, including:

- **Playwright:** Leveraging Playwright for robust end-to-end testing and automation.

- **PostgreSQL Integration:** Exploring PostgreSQL for secure and scalable data management.
